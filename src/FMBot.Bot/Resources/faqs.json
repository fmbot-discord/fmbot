Back then the bot just had `.fm`, the charts, featuring and `.fmyoutube`.\n\nFrikandel joined in when he had the idea of `.friends`, but was too lazy to make his own bot. Together they moved the bot from text files to an actual database and made various other improvements.\n\nSince 2019 Frikandel has been the main maintainer and hoster of .fmbot, adding commands like `.whoknows` and other much-requested features. In March 2021 Frikandel took over all parts of the bot."
